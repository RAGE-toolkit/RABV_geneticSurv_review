## About
This systematic review explores the role of viral sequencing in supporting the global "Zero by 30" initiative aimed at eliminating human deaths from dog-mediated rabies by 2030. By analyzing 220 studies from 94 countries (2000-2023), the review highlights that most sequencing is performed using partial genomes and first-generation technologies, often conducted overseas. The primary rabies reservoir was dogs, although some studies identified local wildlife reservoirs. Viral sequencing has been instrumental in identifying cross-species and transboundary transmission, host shifts, and tracing human rabies sources. However, a lack of standardized methods for classifying viral lineages has limited higher-resolution comparisons. The study stresses the urgent need for in-country sequencing capacity, bioinformatics proficiency, and international cooperation to reduce the spread of rabies and meet the 2030 goal.
## Methods
This review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines
